# metamove

A utility for emulating XFree86-style Meta+click and drag window movement. It currently lacks any sort of user configurability, but I might get around to it eventually. The default bindings are Cmd-Shift-Click for window movement, and Option-Shift-Click for window resizing.

## Install
* chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh
* Enable access for assistive devices in the OS X Accessibility preferences
* Run the binary
